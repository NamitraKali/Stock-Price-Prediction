# Stock Price Prediction

This is my first machine learning project using neural networks. Predicting stock prices is a common project, but that doesn't make it easy. Stocks are known to be very unpredictable, that's because of the many factors that can cause a stock to change. Some of these factors may sometimes be completely unpredicted, such as the case of the internal affairs of the company. On the contrary though, this means that there's also a lot of data and analysis surrounding the stock mark. With the power of Machine Learning and Neural Nets we may be able to harness all that data and create a strong predictive model that can accurately predict stock prices. The preprocessing of the data and construction of the model are shown in the RNN_Predictor python notebook
